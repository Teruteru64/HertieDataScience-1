# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Goals

> "There are no routine statistical questions, only questionable statistical
> routines." --- Sir David Cox

> "Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often
> vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made
> precise." --- John Tukey

Learn how to use visualization and transformation to systematically explore your data to answer or generate questions about your data.

1. What type of variation occurs within my variables?

2. What type of covariation occurs between my variables?


# Variation

## Variation

- \alert{Variation} is the difference between expected output to observed output.

- Visualization of the distribution is different for categorical (`fctr`, `chr`) and continuous (`dbl`, `ìnt`, `dttm`) variables

## Distributions of categorical data
```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

## Distributions of continuous data
```{r, fig.height=4}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.5)
```

## Overlaying multiple distributions 
```{r, fig.height=4}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = carat, colour = cut)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.1)
```

## Typical values
Look for anything unexpected:

* Which values are the most common? Why?

* Which values are rare? Why? Does that match your expectations?

* Can you see any unusual patterns? What might explain them?

* Do observations cluster together?

* How are the observations within each cluster similar to each other?


## Typical values

For example, what does this histogram tell you about typical values?

```{r, fig.height=4}
diamonds %>% 
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)
```

## Clusters of similar values

```{r, fig.height=4}
# Length of eruptions of the Old Faithful Geyser
faithful %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = eruptions)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25)
```  

## Outliers
\alert{Outliers} are data points that do not seem to fit the pattern. They can have substantial effects on the results.

Outliers are difficult to detect in histograms so we may need to 'zoom in' on small values on the y or x-axis.

## Outliers
```{r, fig.height=4}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y), binwidth = 0.5)
```   

## Outliers
```{r, fig.height=4}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y), binwidth = 0.5) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 50))
```   

## Exercises
1. Using the diamonds data

    a. explore the distribution of each of the `x`, `y`, and `z` variables. Can you see any patterns? 
    b. Explore the distribution of `price`. Do you discover anything unusual or surprising?
    c. How many diamonds are 0.99 carat? How many are 1 carat? What do you think is the cause of the difference?

## Exercises solutions

1.1 Explore the distribution of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

- They are right skewed (lots of small diamonds but few very large ones).
- There is an outlier in y, and z.
- All three distributions are bimodal

1.2 Explore the distribution of `price`.

- There are no diamonds with a price of 1500

1.3 How many diamonds are 0.99 carat?

- 70 times more 1 carat diamonds than 0.99 carat diamond.

# Missing values

## Dealing with unusual values

You can deal with outliers and other unusual in several ways:

a. Drop the entire row containing outliers:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
diamonds2 <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(between(y, 3, 20))
```

    + Why might this be a bad idea?

## Dealing with unusual values

b. Replace unusual values with missing values

```{r}
diamonds2 <- diamonds %>% 
  mutate(y = ifelse(y < 3 | y > 20, NA, y))
```

## `ggplot2` way of plotting missing values

`ggplot2` does not include missing values in the plot but displays a warning that they've been removed:

```{r, fig.height=3}
diamonds2 %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Exercises
2.1  What happens to missing values in a histogram?  What happens to missing
    values in a bar chart? Why is there a difference?


## Exercises solutions

2.1 What happens to missing values in a histogram / bar chart?

- In `geom_histogram` missing values are removed. In `geom_bar`, `NA` is treated as another category.


# Covariation

## Covariation between continuous and categorical variables

\alert{Covariation} is the tendency for the values of two or more variables to vary together in a related way.

For example, let look at the covariation between a continuous and categorical variable. We use `..density..`,which is the count standardised, to make the comparison easier.


## Covariation between continuous and categorical variables
```{r, fig.height=3.5}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = price, y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(aes(colour = cut), binwidth = 500)
```

What do the distributions tell you?

## Boxplots

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/boxplot.png")
```

## Boxplots examples
We can use `geom_boxplot()` to plot the distribution of price by cut:

```{r fig.height = 4}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Boxplots examples
Similarly, we can plot the distribution of `class` variable in `mpg`:

```{r fig.height = 4}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Boxplots examples
Reorder `class` based on the median value of `hwy`: 
```{r fig.height = 4}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = reorder(class, hwy, FUN = median), 
                   y = hwy))
```

## Boxplots examples
Rotate the plot by 90°:
```{r fig.height = 4}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = reorder(class, hwy, FUN = median), 
                   y = hwy)) +
  coord_flip()
```

## Exercises
3.1 Create a boxplot to visualize the departure times of cancelled vs. non-cancelled flights.

3.2 Compare and contrast `geom_violin()` with a facetted `geom_histogram()`,
    or a coloured `geom_freqpoly()`. What are the pros and cons of each 
    method?

## Exercises solutions

3.1 Departure times of cancelled vs. non-cancelled flights
```{r, eval = FALSE}
nycflights13::flights %>% 
  mutate(
    cancelled = is.na(dep_time),
    sched_hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100,
    sched_min = sched_dep_time %% 100,
    sched_dep_time = sched_hour + sched_min / 60
  ) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(y = sched_dep_time,
                               x = cancelled))
```

## Exercises solutions
3.1 Departure times of cancelled vs. non-cancelled flights
```{r, echo = FALSE}
nycflights13::flights %>% 
  mutate(
    cancelled = is.na(dep_time),
    sched_hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100,
    sched_min = sched_dep_time %% 100,
    sched_dep_time = sched_hour + sched_min / 60
  ) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(y = sched_dep_time,
                               x = cancelled))
```

## Exercises solutions
```{r, fig.height=4}
# `geom_freqpoly()`
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = price, y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(aes(colour = cut), binwidth = 500)
```

## Exercises solutions
```{r, fig.height=3.7, message=FALSE}
# `geom_violin`
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = price)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~ cut, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y")
```

## Exercises solutions
```{r, fig.height=3.7}
# facetted `geom_histogram`
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price)) + 
  geom_violin() +
  coord_flip()
```

## Covariation between two categorical variables
To visualise the covariation between categorical variables, we'll need to count the number of observations for each combination.

```{r, fig.height=4}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_count(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = color))
```

## Covariation between two categorical variables
Or use `dplyr()` and plot with `geom_tile`:

```{r, fig.height=4}
diamonds %>% 
  count(color, cut) %>%  
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, y = cut)) +
    geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n))
```

## Exercises
4.1 Why is it slightly better to use `aes(x = color, y = cut)` rather
    than `aes(x = cut, y = color)` in the example above?

4.2 Use `geom_tile()` together with dplyr to explore how average flight
    delays vary by destination and month of year.  What makes the 
    plot difficult to read? How could you improve it?

## Exercises solutions
4.1. Why is it better to use `aes(x = color, y = cut)`

- Better to plot the categorical variable with a larger number of categories or the longer labels on the y-axis
- Plot becomes easier to read

## Exercises solutions
4.2 Explore how average flight delays vary by destination and month.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
flights %>%
  group_by(month, dest) %>%
  summarise(dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(month), y = dest,
             fill = dep_delay)) +
  geom_tile() +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Destination",
       fill = "Departure Delay")
```

## Exercises solutions
4.2 Explore how average flight delays vary by destination and month.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
flights %>%
  group_by(month, dest) %>%
  summarise(dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(month), y = dest,
             fill = dep_delay)) +
  geom_tile() +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Destination",
       fill = "Departure Delay")
```

## Exercises solutions
4.2 Explore how average flight delays vary by destination and month. What makes the plot difficult to read? How could you improve it?

- sort destinations by a meaningful quanity (e.g. distance)
- remove missing values
- better color scheme


## Covariation between two continuous variables
Easiest way to visualize the covariation between two continuous variables is to draw a scatterplot with `geom_point()`.

```{r, fig.height=4}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

## Covariation between two continuous variables
Scatterplots become less useful as the size of the dataset grows because points begin to overplot. One solution is to increase transparency with `alpha`. 

```{r, fig.height=4}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price), alpha = 1 / 100)
```

## Covariation between two continuous variables
Another solution is to use `geom_bin2d()` and `geom_hex()` that divide the coordinate plane into 2d bins.

```{r, fig.height=4}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bin2d(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

## Covariation between two continuous variables
```{r, message = FALSE, fig.height=4}
# install.packages("hexbin")
library(hexbin)
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_hex(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

## Covariation between two continuous variables
Another third option is to bin one continuous variable so it acts like a categorical variable. 

```{r, fig.height=4}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot( mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(group = cut_width(carat, 0.1)))
```

## Exercises

5.1 Visualise the distribution of carat, partitioned by price. How does the price distribution of very large diamonds compare to small diamonds (Hint: Look at the `cut_number` function).

5.2 Visualise the combined distribution of cut, carat, and price (Hint: Look at the `cut_number` function).

## Exercises solutions

5.1 Visualise the distribution of carat, partitioned by price.

```{r, fig.height=4}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = cut_number(price, 10), 
                       y = carat)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()
```

## Exercises solutions

5.2 Visualise the combined distribution of cut, carat, and price.

```{r, fig.height=4}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = cut_number(carat, 5), 
                     y = price, color = cut)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

# Final Remarks about Patterns

## Final Remarks about Patterns

Patterns provide clues about relationships because they reveal covariation. If you spot a pattern, ask yourself:

+ Could this pattern be due to coincidence?

+ How can you describe the relationship implied by the pattern?

+ How strong is the relationship implied by the pattern?

+ What other variables might affect the relationship?

+ Does the relationship change if you look at individual subgroups of the data?
